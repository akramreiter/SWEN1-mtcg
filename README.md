# MTCG (SWEN Project)

MTCG is an exploitative gacha game with no substantial gameplay developed by TotallyRealGamesCompanyExploitativeGames. There aren't even marketable characters with cute artworks, just rng-heavy mechanics and a fake currency economy. That's because adding art would increase effort and since we are efficient developers, we decided to concentrate our efforts on the parts that make us money.

Gambling mechanics are not yet implemented, but the odds for pulls are already there. We here at TotallyRealGamesCompanyExploitativeGames take our job seriously and always have our priorities straight. After all, the goal is to extort as much money out of our customers. Wait... shouldn't we implement microtransactions first if that's our top priority?

Current feature list:

- Cards that can be defined on mass through CSV files. Gotta fill up those common and rare rosters with trash no one wants to use.
- Effects that can be triggered on game start, before and after combat. Mostly reserved for legendary and epic cards. ~~We want your pulls without epics or legendaries to feel worthless to increase the dopamine rush from good pulls.~~
- Custom rules for interaction between different monster types, including fun mechanics such as Undead monsters being instantly burned by Fire spells.

Disclaimer: TotallyRealGamesCompanyExploitativeGames doesn't exist and this software doesn't include microtransactions. SWEN MTCG is a project by ??? Kramreiter.
