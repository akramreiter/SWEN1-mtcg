# MTCG (SWEN Project)

MTCG is an exploitative gacha game with no substantial gameplay developed by TotallyRealGamesCompanyExploitativeGames. There aren't even marketable characters with cute artworks, just rng-heavy mechanics and a fake currency economy. That's because adding art would increase effort and since we are efficient developers, we decided to concentrate our efforts on the parts that make us money.

Gambling mechanics were implemented first and the odds are not the most predatory on the market, but certainly not great either. We here at TotallyRealGamesCompanyExploitativeGames take our job seriously and always have our priorities straight. After all, the goal is to extort as much money out of our customers. Wait... shouldn't we have implemented microtransactions first if that's our top priority?

Current feature list:

- Cards that can be defined on mass through CSV files. Gotta fill up those common and rare rosters with trash no one wants to use. Update: cards and packs are implemented now. The game contains:

  - 32 common cards. Let's be real, you'd only use them if you're short on cards overall.
  - 26 rare cards and 2 associated effects. At least you won't feel completely scammed when you pull these.
  - 20 epic cards and 11 associated effects. Really powerful cards that are a worthwhile addition to any deck. Unless you open enough packs to make a deck consisting of only legendary cards, in which case they'll become useless.
  - 14 legendary cards and 12 associated effects. That's the good stuff. The best cards in the game. The ones everyone should want to include in their deck. Buy more packs to gain an advantage over your opponents.

- Effects that can be triggered on game start, before and after combat. Mostly reserved for legendary and epic cards. ~~We want your pulls without epics or legendaries to feel worthless to increase the dopamine rush from good pulls.~~

- Custom rules for interactions monster types have when fighting other cards, including fun mechanics such as Undead monsters being instantly burned by Fire spells.

- A function for playing out a match between 2 players. Since players have no control over the game once it has started, a game can be calculated in a fraction of a second. There are 2 different modes of play:
  **Classic**

  - Played with a deck of 4 cards.
  - Cards that lose a fight will be added to the winner's deck.
  - The game ends when one side has no cards remaining. If no winner is determined after the turn limit of 100, the player with the higher amount of cards in their deck wins.

  **Structured:** 

  - Played with a deck of 12
  - Cards that lose a fight are removed from play.
  - The game ends when one side has no cards remaining. If no winner is determined after the turn limit of 100, the player with the higher amount of cards in their deck wins. Though it's nearly impossible to hit that limit unless a situation where combat between any remaining cards results in a draw occurs.
